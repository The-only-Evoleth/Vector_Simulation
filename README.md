# Simulate Repulsive position Vectors
In this repo, I created positon vectors. They repulse each other until they reach a stabel state.


I initially started this project as a way to simulate the shapes of hybridized molecules.


> however, this project will not give a visual simulation. Instead, the simulated result will be given as position vectors. **These points can be plugged into any application or website like [this](https://academo.org/demos/3d-vector-plotter/) to see the result visually**
